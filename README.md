# PersonalWebsite 
(Disclaimer: the color palette chosen was inspired by [bchiang7](https://github.com/bchiang7) and her website [brittanychiang.com](https://www.brittanychiang.com), however, I used my own take on every other component)

A personal website to showcase some of the work I've done so far. I used my new knowledge of React Native and SASS to create my first implementation of a personal portfolio. It stands to be a website where I can update all the new achievements I've made alongside all the cool projects I participate in.
